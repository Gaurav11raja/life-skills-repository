##How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- M=Motivation,A=Ability and p=prompt, According to BJ Fogg if a task is too hard you need high motivation to perform it and for a easy task you need very little motivation so in order to make a new habit you need to shrink it to tiniest possible version so that very little motivation is needed by making this tiny habit you can make a new big habit.

##Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- learning to celebrate after a tiny win is crucial for habit development, as it increases motivation and confidence. BJ Fogg compares this process to a dog trainer giving a dog a treat after performing a behavior, which helps to reinforce the behavior and create a momentum for positive change.
