# Prevention of Sexual Harassment:

## What Kinds of Behavior Cause Sexual Harassment?
- Sexual harassment happens when someone does things that make another person feel uncomfortable or unsafe because of their gender. This can include unwanted comments, messages, or advances of a sexual nature. It's important to be respectful and not do things that hurt or scare others.

## What Would You Do in Case You Face or Witness Any Incident of Such Behavior?
- If I ever encounter or witness a situation where someone is being mistreated due to their gender or become a target of such behavior, it's my responsibility to take action. I would speak up and directly address the person responsible, telling them that their behavior is unacceptable. I would offer support to the person facing harassment, and if it happens at work or in a public place, I would report it to the relevant authorities or my employer.
