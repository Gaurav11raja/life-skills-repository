# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?
The points in the list that caught my attention are:

1. **Over-communication is Vital:** It's crucial to talk more when things change or get stuck. Keeping everyone informed is super important.

2. **Visual Tools for Clarity:** Using things like pictures, drawings, and videos to explain problems can be a big help. It makes communication easier and clearer.

3. **Respect Others' Time:** Remember that everyone has their own schedules and work to do. Instead of sending lots of small messages, put your questions together in one message. It's more considerate.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I believe I need to improve in the following areas:

1. **Setting Clear Goals:** I should create clear goals for each day and put the most important tasks at the top of the list.

2. **Designating a Dedicated Work Area:** Having a special, distraction-free workspace can help me focus better.

3. **Establishing a Consistent Routine:** Separating work time from leisure time, following the "work when you work, play when you play" rule.

4. **Using Time-Tracking Apps:** I can use apps that keep an eye on how I spend my time. It'll help me see where I can do better.
